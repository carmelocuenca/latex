You can write apps using modern development practices in the programming language of your choice, back it with add-on resources such as SQL and NoSQL databases, Memcached, and many others. You manage your app using the Heroku command-line tool and you deploy code using the Git revision control system, all running on the Heroku infrastructure.''}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Heroku Setup} 
Heroku uses the PostgreSQL database, which means that we need to add the pg gem in the production environment to allow Rails to talk to Postgres
\lstset{language=ruby, style=eclipse}
\begin{lstlisting}
.
.
.
group :production do
  gem 'pg', '0.15.1'
  gem 'rails_12factor', '0.0.2'
end
\end{lstlisting}
To install it, we run \commandinline{bundle install} with a special flag:
\lstset{language=shell}
\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=!]
$ bundle install --without production
\end{lstlisting}
Then 
\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=!]
$ git commit -a -m "Update Gemfile.lock for Heroku"
\end{lstlisting}

The heroku command-line tool is an interface to the Heroku Web API and includes support for things like creating/renaming apps, running one-off dynos, taking backups, and configuring add-ons

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=!]
$ sudo  wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install.sh | sh

$ echo 'PATH="/usr/local/heroku/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source  ~/.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}

It's necessary to create a public/private key pair to deploy code to Heroku. \href{https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys}{\alert{Help? Click here \dots}}

\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=!]
$ heroku login
$ cd ~/rails_projects/<app_name>
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
\end{lstlisting}

Perhaps...
\begin{lstlisting}[escapechar=!]
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
\end{lstlisting}
