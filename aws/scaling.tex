 \item \acrfull{rds} is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud
 \item It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business
 \item \acrshort{rds} gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar \texttt{MySQL}, \texttt{Oracle}, \texttt{Microsoft SQL Server}, or \texttt{PostgreSQL} database engine

\frametitle{DB Security Groups}
It is a good idea to create a DB security group. You can create the DB security group through the AWS Console and add the authorizations.
An authorization is a security group from an EC2 account that allows you to
share RDS instances easily across multiple accounts. Alternatively, you can specify a
CIDR/IP, much like we did for the EC2 security groups. For now, we will allow everyone
access to the DB instances in this group. Later, we’ll restrict that access again. You can
add a DB instance to multiple DB security groups, giving you the necessary flexibility
in case you work with multiple EC2 accounts

\begin{itemize}
\item Load balancing is ``a technique to distribute workload evenly across
two or more computers, network links, CPUs, hard drives, or other resources, in order
to get optimal resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and
avoid overload.'' (Wikipedia)
\item  \acrfull{elb} checks the health of the
instances and will not route traffic to unhealthy instances
\item \acrshort{elb} is not a dedicated program or a hardware device; it is a load-balancing service. As
a service, it can automatically scale its capacity depending on incoming traffic. As a
result, an \acrshort{elb} is not referenced by an IP address, but by a fully qualified domain name

\frametitle{Auto Scaling}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Auto Scaling is a web service that enables you to automatically launch or terminate \acrshort{ec2} instances based on user-defined policies, health status checks, and schedules
 \item Scaling is the ability to increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application by either changing the number of servers (horizontal scaling) or changing the size of the servers (vertical scaling)
\item The decision when to scale vertically and when to scale horizontally depends on factors such as your use case, cost, performance, and infrastructure
\item Auto Scaling allows you to scale your compute resources dynamically and predictably:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Dynamically based on conditions specified by you (for example, increasing CPU utilization of your \acrshort{ec2} instance)
 \item Predictably according to a schedule defined by you (for example, every Friday at 13:00:00)
\end{itemize}

\item Choose Instance Type among  ``micro'', ``small'', ``medium'', \dots
\item Configure details: ``Name'', ``Purchasing option (Request Spot Instances)'', ``IAM Role'' and  ``Monitoring (Enable CloudWatch detailed monitoring)''
\item Add Storage
\item Configure Security Group
\item Review
\end{enumerate}
\item Created an Auto Scaling group by defining maximum, minimum, and (optionally), the desired capacity for the EC2 instances
\begin{enumerate}
\item Configure Auto Scaling group details: ``Launch Configuration'', ``Group name'',  ``Group size Start with \texttt{n} instances'', ``Network'', ``Availability Zone(s)''
\item Configure scaling policies ``Keep this group at its initial size'' or ``Use scaling policies to adjust the capacity of this group''
\item Configure Notifications (Configure your Auto Scaling group to send notifications to a specified endpoint, such as an email address, whenever a specified event takes place, including: successful launch of an instance, failed instance launch, instance termination, and failed instance termination)
\item Review
\end{enumerate}
\item Created an Amazon CloudWatch alarm and defined which metrics to monitor
\item Created two scaling policies, one for scaling out and another for scaling in, and associated the policies with the alarm
\item Associated the scaling policies with the Auto Scaling group

\frametitle{Alarm and Policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item An Auto Scaling group uses a combination of \emph{policies} and \emph{alarms} to determine when the specified conditions for launching and terminating instances are met
\item An \emph{alarm} is an object that watches over a single metric (for example, the average CPU utilization of your EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group) over a time period that you specify. When the value of the metric breaches the thresholds that you define, over a number of time periods that you specify, the alarm performs one or more actions. An action can be sending messages to Auto Scaling
\item A \emph{policy} is a set of instructions for Auto Scaling that tells the service how to respond to alarm messages
\item Along with creating a launch configuration and Auto Scaling group, you need to create the alarms and the scaling policies and associate them with your Auto Scaling group. When the alarm sends the message, Auto Scaling executes the associated policy on your Auto Scaling group to scale the group in (that is, to terminate instances) or scale the group out (that is, to launch instances).
