 \item It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business
 \item \acrshort{rds} gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar \texttt{MySQL}, \texttt{Oracle}, \texttt{Microsoft SQL Server}, or \texttt{PostgreSQL} database engine

\frametitle{DB Security Groups}
It is a good idea to create a DB security group. You can create the DB security group through the AWS Console and add the authorizations.
An authorization is a security group from an EC2 account that allows you to
share RDS instances easily across multiple accounts. Alternatively, you can specify a
CIDR/IP, much like we did for the EC2 security groups. For now, we will allow everyone
access to the DB instances in this group. Later, we’ll restrict that access again. You can
add a DB instance to multiple DB security groups, giving you the necessary flexibility
in case you work with multiple EC2 accounts

      \item Instance is intended for use outside of production or under the \alert{RDS Free Usage Tier}
    \end{itemize}
 \item DB Instance Details (Choose ``depot-app-production'' like \texttt{DB Instance Identifier} (hint: \texttt{DB Instance Identifier} must contain only letters, digits, or hyphens) and \texttt{Master Password} must be at least 8 characteres)
  \item Additional Config (Choose ``depot\_app\_production'' like \texttt{Database Name:} and ``production'' like \texttt{DB Security Group(s):})

\begin{itemize}
\item Load balancing is ``a technique to distribute workload evenly across
two or more computers, network links, CPUs, hard drives, or other resources, in order
to get optimal resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and
avoid overload.'' (Wikipedia)
\item  \acrfull{elb} checks the health of the
instances and will not route traffic to unhealthy instances
\item \acrshort{elb} is not a dedicated program or a hardware device; it is a load-balancing service. As
a service, it can automatically scale its capacity depending on incoming traffic. As a
result, an \acrshort{elb} is not referenced by an IP address, but by a fully qualified domain name

\begin{itemize}
 \item Auto Scaling is a web service that enables you to automatically launch or terminate \acrshort{ec2} instances based on user-defined policies, health status checks, and schedules
 \item Scaling is the ability to increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application by either changing the number of servers (horizontal scaling) or changing the size of the servers (vertical scaling)
\item The decision when to scale vertically and when to scale horizontally depends on factors such as your use case, cost, performance, and infrastructure
\item Auto Scaling allows you to scale your compute resources dynamically and predictably:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Dynamically based on conditions specified by you (for example, increasing CPU utilization of your \acrshort{ec2} instance)
 \item Predictably according to a schedule defined by you (for example, every Friday at 13:00:00)
