Auto Scaling allows you to scale your \gls{ec2} capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define
\begin{itemize}
\item With Auto Scaling, you can ensure that the number of \gls{ec2} instances you’re using increases seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance, and decreases automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs
\item Auto Scaling is particularly well suited for applications that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage
